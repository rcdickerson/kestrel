//! Extracts an aligned program from the [Context]'s e-graph using the
//! [MinLoops] cost function.

//! [MinLoops] is a *local* cost function (each node cost depends only
//! on the cost of its direct children), leading to very efficient
//! extraction. However, it only considers syntactic properties around
//! the number of merged loops, and is not capable of finding
//! alignments with desirable semantic properties which require
//! operations such as loop scheduling or unrolling.
